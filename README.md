An scenario is that an user, lets call her Peggy.
Peggy is walking around in the city she lives, notices an broken lamppost and wanna fulfill her citizens responsibility.

She takes up her mobilephone and open Fixit app and takes an photo of the fault. She presses save and adds an comment to the picture.
"Broken lamppost.. pls Fixit!" And now she can walk away from the lamppost feeling great that she done something for the city!

Picture, gps-info and comment are uploaded to Firebase.

Later an streetworker/repairman working for the city login to the Administrator side of the app.
And there hen can see what needs to be fixed on Apple maps, or on a tableview. He gets the driving instructions from Apple maps and get there to fix the problem!
